	I do not like how I cannot add multiple different titles and projects per day. If I am working on 2 seperate things I want to log them as 2 seperate things and then add that to my day.
	
	I would prefer if all the logistics are done on the day by day and if the Logs had the days but would also show multiple inputs per day.

	Bug when you edit a log, you cannot click submit but it will save nevertheless. You must hit cancel to exit the log instead of submit. This is located in the LOGs section
