CAN is the data communication standard in the automotive industy

Lots of CHAOS in the system, therefore the system must be robust and reliable

CAN is a multi-master serial communicaion bus whose basic design specification calls for high speed high noise immunity & error detection features

CAN offers data communication up to 1 Mbit/specification

Error confinement and error detection features make i very reliable.

FEATURES --------
    Low cost
    Extreme robustness
    High data transmission speeds
    Reliablility, error handleing and noise confinement
    Automatic re-tranmission of faulty messages
    Automatic bus disconnection of fualty nodes
    Functional addressing - data messages do not contain source or destination addresses, only identifies relating to their function.


CAN is a broadcast type of bus
    does not send data from point a to point bus
        -all devices hear the tranmission
        -no way to send data specifically to one nodes
        -all nodes will pick up the traffic on the bus

Can controller on the microcontroller
 -2 signal ended pins
    CAN_TX (transfer)
    CAN_RX (receiver)
You cannot use these digital signals to communticate with another nodes

Use differecial signals to communicate with other nodes.

There is a need to convert singles ended signals to differencial signal
 -need a can tranceiver
    CANH (CAN High) 
    CANL (CAN Low)
    -These are differecial signals

The controller and the transceiver make up one node.

Can will have two lines.
    A High line and a Low line
        CANH connects to High
        CANL connects to Low
