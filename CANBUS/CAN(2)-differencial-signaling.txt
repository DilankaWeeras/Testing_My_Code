CANH and CANL are differecial

Differencial Signaling is a method of communication using complimetary signals

Single ended -
    High is logical one and Low is logical zero
    5V may be logical 1
    0V may be logical 0

Differencial Signal -
    There is a Vcm for the voltage at the common mode
    There is a Vdm for the voltage at the diffencial mode

    These are compilmentary signals
        To send logical 1
            Singal 1 is +5V
            Signal 2 is -5V
        The reciver considers the difference between the signals as the logic
            10V difference is logical 1

        To send logical 0
            Signal 1 is -5V
            Signal 2 is +5V
        Difference betweend signals 
            -10V difference is logical 0

        Noise is added equally to both of the signals so the noise cancelling happends automatically

Used in USB, SATA, CAN, and More.

IN CAN-----------

    Want to transmit logical 1
        CANH - 2.5V
        CANL - 2.5V
            Reccesive state of the can bus
            Difference is 0V

    Want to transmit logical 0
        CANH - 3.5V
        CANL - 1.5V
            Dominant state of the can bus
            Diffence is 2.5V

Reccesive == 1
Dominant == 0


Example 1:

TI SN65HVD223-HT 3.3V CAN Transciever
    
    Functional Block Diagram----------
        CANH and CANL outputs 
        D - Driver Signal
        R - Reciver outputs

        CANL is produces by complimenting the outputs
            NOT gate
        
        Everything you transmit is sent to the reciver

        if D == 1
            //CANH and CANL go to revessive state
            Difference = 0V
        if D == 0 
            //CANH and CANL go to the dominant state
            Difference = 2V

    Driver Electrical Characteristics------------
        Bus output voltage (dominant)
            D == 0
                CANH = Vcc // 3.3V
                CANL = 1.25V //
                //Difference is 3.3 - 1.25 = 2.05V
            D == 1
                CANH = 2.3V
                CANL = 2.3V
                //Difference is 0V
    
For many Transcievers the output may be the same but the Voltage values may be different
