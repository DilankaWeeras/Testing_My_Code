BUS access from Multiple Nodes
    The CAN communication protocol is a carrier-sense, multiple access protocol with collision detection and abitration om message prioirty
    
    CSMA means that eahch node on a bus must wait for a prescibed period of inactivity before attemption to send a message. 
    CD+AM means that collisions are resolved through a bit-wise arbitration, based on a preprogramed priority.
    Each message is preprogram for heiarchy and the higher priority identifier always wins the bus access.



Bitwise arbitration in CAN  
    NODES       Arbitration ID
    NODE -1     0x65D (110 0101 1101)
    NODE -2     0x676 (110 0111 0110)
    NODE -3     0x659 (110 0101 1001)

If all of these nodes were to access the CAN bus at the same time
NODE -3 wins because it has the lowest 11-bit identifier.
    The LOWER the arbitration number the HIGHER the priority
